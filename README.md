## Overview

In the hospitality industry, pricing strategies play a crucial role in maximizing revenue and ensuring competitiveness. The ability to predict hotel room prices with accuracy is fundamental for both hotel management and customers. The problem lies in the inherent unpredictability of hotel prices, influenced by various dynamic factors such as demand fluctuations, market competition, seasonal trends, local events, customer preferences, and economic conditions. Traditionally, pricing has been a reactive process, with limited capacity to anticipate price fluctuations, leading to revenue loss or missed opportunities for both hoteliers and consumers. Therefore, an effective hotel price prediction system is needed to assist both sides in making informed decisions.
